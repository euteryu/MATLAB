# MATLAB

## ! Very specific directory structure for this code to run !
- main driver code .m files in Week9 main dir
- Sort Fz_data_* into Controls/ or Patients/ (after creating folders manually or in code)
- Create Epoched_data/ and MMN_/ in code. Rest of code should make use of that via abs paths.
